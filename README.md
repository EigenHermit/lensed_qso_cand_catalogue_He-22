## Strongly Lensed QSOs Candidates at DESI-LS DR9  

### Demostration:         
This is an attched repository of He+2022 (AA submitted).               
It contains three parts:                 
Firstly, KLQ, which is the validation set that composed by confirmed systems.            
Secondly, the H22 Candidates, including the catalogues and the corresponding images.             
Lastly, the QGC (quasar group catalogue). Since the large file size, the Google Drive is used to provide downloading services.
